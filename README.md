# Handwritten-digit-recognition-MNIST

This is a 5 layers Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset.

I choosed to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive.

Achieved accuracy is 98.51% with this CNN trained on a GPU,  Not having a GPU powered machine it might take a little longer, 
try reducing the epochs (steps) to reduce computation and to save time.


# Dataset:
The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

The below is the image of size 28x28.
